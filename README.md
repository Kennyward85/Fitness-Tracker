# Fitness-Tracker

Created an app for tracking Workouts using a Mongoose/Mongodb schema to keep track of the type of work our weight, reps, sets.
If cardio distance and time ran that will update on the main  page showing last workout infor and you can also add new workouts to the overall list
Then there is a database page which will give you charts and metrics of the workouts done and pie and donut charts

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
