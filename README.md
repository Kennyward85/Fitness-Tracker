# Fitness-Tracker

Created an app for tracking Workouts using a Mongoose/Mongodb along with express and javascript to keep track of the type of work our weight, reps, sets.
Cardio distance and time ran that will update on the main along with the other workouts, you can also add new workouts to the overall list.
Then there is a database page which will give you charts and metrics of the workouts done for the week.

## User Story

* I want the useer to be able to view create and track daily workouts. They should be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they will be able to track the distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.
